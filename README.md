# DCT Tracking - GET Request

This Google Tag Manager template makes a GET request to the Dentsu Creative analytics endpoint when loaded.

The main need for this template and a GET request instead of the original script is for the purposes of aligning Dentsu Creative with the website's cookie consent and an external consent management solution.


Usage:
1. Copy the accountId (could be empty), campaignId (could be empty), and hostname endpoint fields from the Dentsu Creative generated from DCT system to the template variable.
2. Select if Dentsu Creative  Tracking Opt-in is being used
